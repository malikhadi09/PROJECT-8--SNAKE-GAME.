# PROJECT-8--SNAKE-GAME.
A snake game project, using the concept of OOP I made this project. I'm using loops, nested loops, function, variable etc to built this game. It is a simple game like the old classic if the snake head eat it tails get bigger and if the head and the tail meet then the snake will die and the game will end.
